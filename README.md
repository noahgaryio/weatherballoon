## Summary

​The video provides a comprehensive guide on how to launch a GoPro camera into space using a weather balloon.​ Presented by Haley Nelson, the tutorial covers each aspect of the process, from assembling the payload and selecting the right parachute and balloon, to planning the launch and retrieving the equipment after it descends back to Earth.

## Key Points

### Understanding the Payload

- 00:30 The payload refers to whatever is sent into space; in this case, five GoPro cameras were secured in a styrofoam box and equipped with a GPS unit.
- 01:00 Each GoPro was strategically placed to capture different angles of the journey, highlighting the importance of having extra battery life for the cameras.
- 02:10 The payload should be under four pounds for legal reasons, and it is recommended to include contact information on the payload for recovery purposes.

### Equipment and Setup

- 02:50 A parachute needs to be selected according to the size of the payload; a six-foot parachute was deemed excessive for this project, illustrating the need for careful planning.
- 04:00 A weather balloon, specifically a 300-gram balloon that can reach altitudes of 80,000 feet, should be purchased, with a recommendation to buy two due to fragility.
- 05:40 Helium is required to fill the balloon, which can be conveniently sourced from Party City, making the preparation process more accessible.

### Launch Planning

- 06:30 It's important to choose a launch site that avoids controlled airspace; tools like Sky Vector can help determine safe locations.
- 07:10 Predicting where the payload will land is possible with tools like PredictaBob, which consider various variables including weather and launch conditions.
- 08:14 On launch day, attaching the balloon to both the helium tank and parachute securely is essential for success.

### Recovery Phase

- 08:55 After launch, tracking the payload via GPS is crucial, as it helps locate the equipment once it descends back to Earth.
- 09:42 The retrieval process is emphasized as being rewarding, with GPS accuracy ensuring that the payload can be found easily. The excitement of successfully recovering the payload is highlighted as a memorable part of the experience.
